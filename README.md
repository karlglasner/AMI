# AMI (Approximate Model Inference)

This repository contains matlab code for parameter estimation in systems of ODEs using
the AMI method (see K.Glasner,  Learning differential equations in the presence of data and model uncertainty, 2022)

The inputs and outputs are described in the ami.m file.

There are also two example ODE function files, fhn.m and lorenz.m, showing the correct array-operation syntax.
